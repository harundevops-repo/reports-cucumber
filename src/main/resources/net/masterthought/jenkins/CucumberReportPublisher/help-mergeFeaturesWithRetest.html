<p>Merge features and scenarios from different JSON files of different runs into a single report by features and scenarios ids.</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b><br />
    Original cucumber report is "cucumber.json". Let's look a situation when couple of tests failed there.
    Cucumber runner generates a new report, for example, cucumber-rerun.json as a result of rerun the failed tests.
    <br />
    In that case you will have a merged report where all failed tests from the original cucumber.json file
    are overridden with the results from the cucumber-rerun.json.
